# üß† About
This SnapChat Clone uses Firebase as a database and authentication and for the UI we use StyleSheets
When you signing up you will have your location pinged to show up on the map,
if the email that you have typed in has been used you will recive a alert and will not continue to the next screen.
The next screen is the name screen you can type in anything or nothing and it will continue.
The next screen is the birthday screen there are no set restrictions to the button yet so any selected birthday will be continue to the next screen.
The only screens that have button restictions are the Login and Sign Up.
After the birthday screen is the Username screen feel free not to add a username. 
After all the Sign Up screens are done you will be navigated to the home screen of the app where you can take a photo, save it, and turn on and off flash.
